# KiDi (Kid Diary) - G0_BE

When I started this project, I was just an average frontend developer, and I found myself unemployed due to the impact of last year's layoff.

This project will begin with the backend written in Golang, and I have not yet determined which framework the frontend will use, but it is highly likely to be React.

KiDi is an application designed to store all the images and videos of my son, as well as document our journey together.

It serves as a self-learning project, a toolkit on my journey to becoming a full-stack developer.

**Good luck, bro!** =)
